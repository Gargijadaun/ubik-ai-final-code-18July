Hydrofil is a great moisturizing cream to make the skin well hydrated and soft. After using it for 2 months, my skin has become velvety smooth.Though it is perfect for dry skin, but I will suggest if you are 30+ then you should try this amazing cream to provide necessary moisturization for the skin to avoid wrinkles.

About Founder
Ilesh Khakhkhar
Founder & Managing Director of UBIK Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Hi! Let me introduce myself! I am Ilesh Khakhkhar, the founder of one of the fastest-growing cosmeceutical organizations in India, Ubik Solutions. Ubik is the way to fulfill my vision of leaving this world a better place than I found. It all started back in 2003 when I launched my first pharma company Ethicare Remedies with just 3 products. I did not belong to a wealthy family, and the odds of my company becoming a success were against me. But my passion to give something new and innovative to the world didn’t let me sleep.   For more than two decades, I fully submerged myself in the dermatology industry. As I wanted to change the face of cosmetology and dermatology, I kept on taking chances and gradually expanded my business by launching new companies like Ethinext Pharma, Ethiall Remedies, Brand You, iDoc Solutions, iDoc Academy, Dermapreneur, Post Adda and Mydermastore. From a very young age, I had the natural ability to encourage everyone I meet with a positive spirit and it helped me connect with people easily. By regularly launching state of art products and services in response to the genuine needs expressed by clients, I have been able to make new trends in the dermatology industry. I can proudly say that I am working on my vision by doing what I am passionate about. I am grateful that I get to work with industry experts and hope to hear from you as well.
Bhavini Khakhkhar
Co-Founder & Managing Director of UBIK Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Hi. This is Bhavini Khakhkhar. I remember while I was a teenager, there was a craze for beautiful cosmetics and make-up knick-knacks. I watched ads luring people to buy the best cosmetic products - and when they actually bought them, did not turn out as sleek and heavenly as they were promised! That was my first turning point – I promised myself to build the best cosmetic-products line in India which will stand true to the expectation of the buyer.  I wanted to make beauty products which would make my buyers happy and satisfied – and this gave birth to our first company ‘Ethicare Remedies’, a company that makes the most skin-friendly beauty products.  Born and brought up as a down-to-earth girl with goodness and kindness as the core values that I have inherited from my parents, I married at a very early age. After 9 years of our marriage, we decided to start our own business ‘Ethicare Remedies’. With a desire to make the world a more beautiful place and a mission of ‘innovation is our identity’ we continuously thrive to deliver the best. Today, we are all set to offer products that stand true on the test of quality and affordability as well as give back to the society through Ubik Solutions. Every single day - I wake up with the feeling of gratitude that I am a part of this beautiful mission. Every single day, I commit myself to take a step forward, to learn new lessons and adopt the changes necessary to uplift my skills and knowledge. As I achieve my dreams, every person associated with me is gracefully empowered to achieve their dreams.  We, as a team working forUbik Solutions, are eternally grateful, happy and ever-evolving, and we are determined to make a difference – to help elevate each person who is associated with us, to make their lives better and beautiful.   Success for me is a matter of defying expectations, overcoming the odds, and creating opportunities to succeed where they might not otherwise exist.
